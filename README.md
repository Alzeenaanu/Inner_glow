### Project Description
Mental health issues among women are often overlooked, leading to inadequate support. The *Special Women Mental Health Support System* provides a platform for users to track emotions, manage stress , monitor menstrual cycles, and receive mental health guidance through journaling, mood logging, meditation suggestions, and a chatbot.



### The Problem statement
Mental health, especially among women, is often impacted by various emotional and physical factors that can be difficult to track and manage. Many individuals face challenges in recognizing patterns in their mood, managing stress, or understanding the connections between their mental health and factors like hormonal changes or daily stressors. Existing mental health tracking tools are often fragmented or not tailored to the specific needs of women, resulting in an increased risk of untreated mental health conditions.

The *Special Women Mental Health Support System* seeks to address these issues by providing an integrated, user-friendly platform designed specifically for women. The system will allow users to track their daily mood, maintain journal entries, receive personalized meditation suggestions via YouTube, and monitor their menstrual cycles. Additionally, a default chatbot will assist users in generating insights and offering preliminary support for mental health challenges. This solution aims to empower women to take control of their mental health and improve their overall well-being by offering a safe, accessible, and comprehensive tracking experience.

### The Solution
The *Special Women Mental Health Support System* turns mental health tracking into a breeze (and even a little fun!). It's like having a personal assistant who not only helps you track your mood but also reminds you to take a deep breath with personalized meditation suggestions. You‚Äôll get insights on how your emotions and hormones are playing tag throughout the month, all while journaling your thoughts and experiences. Plus, our chatbot is always there for a friendly chat, ready to offer some guidance when you need it. It‚Äôs your go-to space to feel supported, in control, and empowered to manage both your mind and body. All while having a little fun along the way!
